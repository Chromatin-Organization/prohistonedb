<h2>DUF1931 histones</h2>
<p><a href="{{ url_for('search.index', cid=categories[id|int].id) }}">DUF1931 histones</a> are predominantly found in bacteria but they also appear in the Thermococci archaea.
They are pseudodimeric histones, meaning that two histone folds are encoded in one polypeptide chain.
The two histone folds self dimerise in the dimer prediction.
The linker which connects the two histone folds contains an extra alpha helix.
AlphaFold predicts a dimer structure which looks similar to the face-to-face tetramer prediction.
As we find no conserved conventional DNA binding residues, we are uncertain if DUF1931 histones bind DNA.
Little is known about these histones, except a crystal structure of the monomer and that the Thermococci DUF1931 histones might play a role in temperature adaptation [1,2].</p>
