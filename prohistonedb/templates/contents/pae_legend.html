<h3>Predicted aligned error</h3>
<p>
    The predicted aligned error (PAE) values are visualized in a 2-dimensional plot and range from 0 to 30 Å.<br>
    They show how confident AlpaFold2 is in the relative positions of residues.<br>
    The PAE value at (x,y) is the expected distance error of residue x relative to residue y when residue y would have been aligned to the true structure.<br>
    For multimer predictions, the residues of all the chains are appended on the y and x-axis and the different chains are separated by thick black lines.

<p>
    Low distance errors (&lt;10Å) indicate that AlphaFold2 is confident in the relative position of the residues in question.<br>
    Domains can be identified from the PAE plot by comparing the distance errors between residues from the same chain.<br>
    Confident interfaces between domains can be identified from the PAE by comparing the distance errors between residues from different chains.<br>
