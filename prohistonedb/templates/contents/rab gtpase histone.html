<h1>Rab GTPase histone</h1>
<p>Rab GTPase histones are part of the a3 superfamily as they contain a truncated a3 helix.
They are exclusive to Lokiarchaeota.
Rab GTPase histones have a fold-to-fold-like histone domain on their C-terminus and a eukaryotic-like small Rab GTPase domain on their N-terminus.
The function of these histones is unknown.</p>
