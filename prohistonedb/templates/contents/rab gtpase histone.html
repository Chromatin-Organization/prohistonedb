<h2>Rab GTPase histone</h2>
<p><a href="{{ url_for('search.index', cid=categories[id|int].id) }}">Rab GTPase histones</a> are part of the a3 superfamily as they contain a truncated a3 helix.
They are exclusive to Lokiarchaeota.
Rab GTPase histones have a fold-to-fold-like histone domain on their C-terminus and a eukaryotic-like small Rab GTPase domain on their N-terminus.
The function of these histones is unknown.</p>
