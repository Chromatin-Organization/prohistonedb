<h2>Transmembrane histone</h2>
<p><a href="{{ url_for('search.index', cid=categories[id|int].id) }}">Transmembrane (TM) histones</a> are found in some bacterial and archaeal metagenomes.
They are rare and are not conserved in any known group of prokaryotes.
TM histones are defined as histones that have a C-terminal transmembrane domain.
The a1 helix is often missing in the histone fold.
Therefore, we expect these histones to have lost their DNA-binding ability.</p>
