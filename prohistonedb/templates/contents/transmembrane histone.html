<h1>Transmembrane histone</h1>
<p><a href="/search?cid=4">Transmembrane (TM) histones</a> are found in some bacterial metagenomes.
They are rare and are not conserved in any known group of bacteria.
TM histones contain a transmembrane domain on their C-terminus.
The a1 helix is often missing in the histone fold.
Therefore, we predict that these histones do not bind DNA.
Their function is unknown.</p>
