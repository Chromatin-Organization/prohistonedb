<h3>Nanohalo coiled-coil histone</h3>
<p><a href="{{ url_for('search.index', cid=categories[id|int].id) }}">Nanohalo coiled-coil histones</a> are exclusive to Nanohaloarchaea.
They are similar to coiled-coil histones in that they contain a C-terminal helix which facilitates tetramerization by forming a coiled-coil structure.
However, their sequences diverge strongly from coiled-coil histones.</p>
