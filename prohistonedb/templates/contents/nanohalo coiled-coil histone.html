<h1>Nanohalo coiled-coil histone</h1>
<p>Nanohalo coiled-coil histones are exclusive to Nanohaloarchaea.
They are similar to coiled-coil histones in that they contain a C-terminal helix which facilitates tetramerization by forming a coiled-coil structure.
However, their sequences diverge strongly from coiled-coil histones.</p>
