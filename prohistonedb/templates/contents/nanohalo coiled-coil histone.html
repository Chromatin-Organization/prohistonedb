<h3>Nanohalo coiled-coil histone</h3>
<p><a href="{{ url_for('search.index', cid=categories[id|int].id) }}">Nanohalo coiled-coil histones</a> are coiled-coiled-like histones from Nanohaloarchaea.
Like coiled-coil (CC) histones, Nano CC histones have a C-terminal α-helix which is predicted to facilitate tetramerization.
We put the CC histones from Nanohaloarchaea in a separate category because they share &lt;20% sequence identity with CC histones.</p>
